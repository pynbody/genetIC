# Test grafic (i.e. multi-grid-based) particle mapping
# This example is actually quite complicated: ask for flagging 1 on virtual coarse, 1 on real coarse, 1 on real zoom
# 1 on virtual coarse (32) => downscaled to 8 new flags on real coarse (64)
# 1 on real coarse (64) => upscaled to 1 new flag on virtual coarse (32)
# 1 on real zoom (256) => downscaled to 1 new flag on virtual zoom (128)
# Total 3 existing + 10 new flags = 13 ids flagged
#
# Post 2018 (propagation of flags for grafic mapper)
# 1 on real zoom (256) => downscaled to 1 new flag on virtual zoom (128) + 1 new on 64 + 1 new on 32
# Total 3 existing + 12 new flags = 15 ids flagged
