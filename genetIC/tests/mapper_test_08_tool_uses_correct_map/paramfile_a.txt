# Test that the output mapper, not the input mapper, is used by the mapper tool
#
# This also tests a case of taking a single particle in a gadget file and mapping
# it to grafic grids. Because grafic grids don't specify which zoom level will
# actually be used, this generates flags on *all* levels. Moreover because
# of the use of subsampling, there is a strange effect that one ends up with
# 2^3=8 cells flagged on the 128^3 intermediate res level.
